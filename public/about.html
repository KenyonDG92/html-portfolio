  <h2> If you are serious at all you must first talk to a lender. </h2>

  If you are serious at all about making a move you must first talk to a lender.The lender talks to the banks about the loan types that may be available
   and fetches the information dependant on your finacial report and then gets a print out on price range of what you can afford.
  For some reason I don't know why this part makes people feel hesitant. I know personally I would like to know my money borrowing power just in case of an emergency. 
  I have a lender who will break it down for you without that fake sales pitch. They will ask you the right questions and make
  you aware of the realty of what it takes for you to be set on the right track from the beginning.
  
  As a buyer you need to understand info regarding some basic questions(See below):
<ul>
  <li>How much money do I need to have for a downpayment & in my account left over in order for the lenders to approve the loan?
  </li>
  <li>What is an appraisal and why do I need it in order to qualify for a loan?</li>
  <li>Why does debt to income effect how much of a loan I can get even though my credit is good?</li>
  <li>How long do I have to be at my job in order to qualify for a loan?</li>
</ul> 

</p>

<p>I am here to guide you and connect you to the right services for whatever nitch that you endever.Im not going to talk you in
  to doing something that you don't want to do. If you want my opinion, I will tell you what I see and connect you to the right person if 
  I dont know the answer.
